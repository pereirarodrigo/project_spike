        "Neurons can be divided into three different parts: dendrites, soma and axon. The dendrites, roughly speaking, act as the neuron's input receivers and relay this information directly to the neuron's body, the soma, which essentially acts as a processing unit: should the processed input exceed a certain threshold, then an output signal is generated and transmitted to the axon, which relays the output to other neurons. The junction between two neurons is known as the synapse - the terms presynaptic and postsynaptic originate from this definition, and are often used to designate a neuron that transmits information and a neuron that receives it, respectively.\r\n",
